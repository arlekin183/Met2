# WorkMeter2

This is a test Task to Angular middle developer. Full description (but only on Russian) is located in 'Описание тестового задания.pdf'.
While this project is located on Github, its developer is looking for a job :)

## Development server

First run in a separate terminal window a `node server.js` command. 
Then run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4201/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
